# sortingAlgorithms
This is a terminal program using C++ where I've created a menu where you can use and decide the a type of list (integers, strings, fractions, etc)
and use the different sorting algorithms to compare and learn the efficiency and complexity of the algorithm. Planning on making it a 
website application to create a more visual and complete experience.
